## Description

Profile for the Rackham cluster <https://www.uu.se/centrum/uppmax/resurser/kluster/rackham>.

Each compute node consists of two (2) Intel Xeon E5 2630 v4 at 2.20 GHz/core
(10 cores, 20 threads, 25 MB LLC, and a bandwidth of 68.3 GB/s). Each
compute node has either 8x16384MB (128GB) or 16x16384MB (256GB) or 16x65536MB
(1TB) of ECC 2400MHz DIMM DRAM memory. For local storage each compute node has
a 2TB disk at 7200RPM.

RAM for a standard compute node in the "core" partition: 128/20=6.4GB=6400MB per core.
